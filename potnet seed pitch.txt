Traceability System for Washington State Liquor Control Board
http://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=314-55-087

Initiative I-502 passed in November 2012. The Washington State Legislature rules specify an extensive traceability system http://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=314-55-087

A thousand licensed businesses. Law says we need to log pretty much every event in the growth and sale of the plant across the supply chain. 

I work in a community of family farmers in Springdale, Washington. Compliance is a big problem for them. 

I keep hearing complaints about the state traceability system

Slow for big inventories. Single select - you can only do one operation on one plant and a time. Free system is purposefully slow so that licensees will pay $450 / mo for full version of BioTrackTHC frontend software. The expensive system comes in package deals - packaging coming with expensive hardware and overcomplicated software. Because BioTrack started as the only show in town, it has built a dilemma for licensees: do I use the one-at-time free crappy software or the expensive slightly better crappy software? This is a market ready for disruption. 

The medical collectives are coming onto the retail system right now. Another thousand businesses that need to do compliance. Market is growing.

Didn't want collectives to get too big. Market structured to make lots of competing small players.

I want: Money to set up an office in Seattle, hire a software team, advertise.

I have had the good fortune to find this business opportunity. I have the coding skills to build a working proof-of-concept HTML5 website/ app. I need a partner who can help fund raise and organize make the business big. The real opportunity here is getting in now and taking the whole market and holding it. There are significant cash flow streams to be captured and held.

All of the functionality of BioTrack THC is available via the WSLCB public API implemented under contract by BioTrackTHC. Any third party can send compliance information via HTTP directly to the WSCLB's server.

> (a) Key notification of "events," such as when a plant enters the system (moved from the seedling or clone area to the vegetation production area at a young age);

> (c) When a lot or batch of marijuana, marijuana extract, marijuana concentrates, marijuana-infused product, or marijuana waste is to be destroyed;

"How Much?"
Cost of a software team, office.
